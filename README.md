# machine-learning-implementation

This repository contains scripts that demonstrate the inner workings of various machine learning algorithms.

## model-selection.py

This script produces a plot illustrating the different algorithms of the gradient descent method when finding the minimum of Rosenbrock's Banana Function. It also gives where the minimum of the function occurs.

	python3 model-selection.py

Example output:
